Billing
=======

When you sign up for Managed Services for Google Cloud Platform, Rackspace will
become your reseller of GCP services. This means that all billing of both
infrastructure and management charges is provided through a consolidated
Rackspace bill, and you do not have to maintain a payment relationship for
those projects with Google directly. The credit card you provided when
signing up for your Rackspace account will be automatically billed for
both your GCP infrastructure, management charges and on-demand support
fees, as described below.

Billing Cycles
--------------

Google bills for all infrastructure on a calendar month basis. GCP charges
for the previous month's usage are typically finalized by the 10th day of
each month. After the charges are finalized by Google, both infrastructure
and management charges are added to your Rackspace account and will appear
on your next Rackspace bill. Each line item will include the month in which
the charges were incurred. Your Rackspace bill is created the 15th of each
month, unless you are using an account originally created for the Rackspace
Public Cloud, in which case you will be billed based on the anniversary date
the account was created.

Monthly Management Fees
-----------------------

Monthly management fees for each Aviator GCP project will be billed at the
rate agreed upon during the project's onboarding. During your first month of
management for each GCP project, your monthly management fee is prorated
based on the start date of management.

On-Demand Support Fees
----------------------

On-Demand support fees for a Runway project ticket are estimated and
scoped up front for each ticket by the support team. The fee needs to be
agreed to before work begins. Agreed upon fees are included in the upcoming
billing cycle.

On-Demand support fee is structured as a cost for the ticket and a cost for
the time spent on the ticket. Time is billed in 30 minute increments,
rounded up.

Viewing your Invoices
---------------------

To view your invoices, log in to the
`Managed Services for Google Cloud Platform Control Panel <https://manage.rackspace.com/gcp>`_,
select the Account dropdown at the top right corner, and select Billing
Overview.

The primary account holder will receive an email any time a payment is
processed, indicating that a new invoice is available for review.

Modifying your Payment Method
-----------------------------

If you need to update the credit card or ACH (eCheck - United States only)
details that you have on file, log in to the
`Managed Services for Google Cloud Platform Control Panel <https://manage.rackspace.com/gcp>`_,
select the Account dropdown at the top right corner, and select Billing
Overview. From there, you'll find a link to update your payment details.

Native GCP Project Billing Account Access
-----------------------------------------

All GCP projects under Rackspace management are associated with a single
Rackspace owned GCP billing account for your organization. Rackspace
automatically grants billing account access to the user who linked the
organization with billing:admin rights. This user can manage who else in
the organization has access to native GCP billing features.
